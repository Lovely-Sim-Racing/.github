I'm Constantinos, and this is Lovely Sim Racing. I've been driving pretend race cars since 2020. Along the way, I also created the Lovely Dashboard, a multifunctional feature packed SimHub Dashboard.

Used by thousands* of sim racers across the world, the Lovely Dashboard (and ecosystem) has become a staple in every ones sim racing setups. From professionals like Tony Kanaan all the way to rookies, the Lovely Dashboard delivers the best and most consistent information for all simulators.

It is completely free for everyone to use, but in order to develop, maintain and create new features, it does require plenty of time. And that is why I seek your sponsorship and help...  Becoming a Lovely Member strengthens my commitment to always deliver the best possible experience for sim racing enthusiasts and professionals.
